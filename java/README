This provides weka.jar files which include the following external jars
listed below together with the URLs from which their sources can be
obtained:

  arpack_combined_all.jar: <http://icl.cs.utk.edu/f2j/>
  core.jar: <https://github.com/fommil/netlib-java>
  mtj.jar: <https://github.com/fommil/matrix-toolkits-java>

As long as the WPM() code uses the WekaPackageManager main() method, we
need to ensure in src/main/java/weka/core/WekaPackageManager.java that
this does not call System.exit(0) [added in c8982], i.e., apply

and hence build our own weka.jar from the Weka sources via

  ant compile
  ant exejar

and use dist/weka.jar for RWekajars/inst/java/weka.jar.

32-bit OS X only had 1.5, but this is no longer supported:

The developer version releases available from 

  http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index_downloading.html

are all compiled for Java 1.6.

However, for Mac OS X Java 1.6 is only available for 64 bits, and in
particular the CRAN Mac OS X build/check system is 32 bits.

Hence, recompile weka.jar for Java 1.5.

To do so, go to ~/src/org/weka/weka or alternatively, grab a Weka
Developer version release .zip for Linux, unpack the .zip itself and
then unarchive the thus obtained weka-src.jar with the sources.

Ensure that build.xml has

  source="1.5" target="1.5"

in its compile target.
